MusicProject

This project concerns mapping numbers to notes of piano keys in MIDI. For some sequence of digits, Musicify maps those digits to any key in any octave using a variety of different "extensions" as there are more digits than notes in a key. This allows one to create infinite melodies using transcendental numbers like pi. You can theoretically make a song of infinite length and varying melodies using different transcendental numbers.usicProject
